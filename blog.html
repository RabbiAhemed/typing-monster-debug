    <h2>Q1. Local Storage vs Session Storage?</h2>
    <p>
      Local storage and session storage are almost similar but there is a bit
      difference.Local storage and session storage are used to store data in the
      browser Session storage’s data is wiped or cleared when a particular
      session or tab is closed.and opening a new tab creates a new session
      storage for that particular tab.if the tab or browser is closed the
      session storage will be lost.Session storage is for one browsing session
      and it is removed as soon as the user closes the tab where that session
      was set. While local storage is around forever until the user deletes
      it.In a word session storage’s data is persisted until the tab or window
      is closed. The main difference is that local storage’s data does not
      expire,the data is shared across, data is persisted even after closing the
      session or tab.local storage’s objects properties can be set by using
      setItem() and then can be accessed/retrieved by using getItem().Also
      deletion/removal is possible using removeItem()

    <h2>Q2. Global scope vs Block scope?</h2>
    <p>
      A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is
      considered a global scope variable. The global variables can be accessed
      by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the
      curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
      conditional statements, or something else. It is only allowed to refer to
      these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

    <h2>Q3. How does Javascript Event loop works?</h2>
    <p>
      The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform
      non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event
      loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will
      again check for any other tasks that need to be performed. The Event Loop
      has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If
      the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the
      queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
      an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. The event loop executes
      tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty. The event
      loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.
